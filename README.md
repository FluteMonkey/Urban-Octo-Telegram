This file contains html and css for a website I was tasked with fixing. There are many changes from the original code I was given including,
optimization of the css file to make it easier to read, adding comments to the css stylesheet so that others can understand the code easier.
Some of the classes were also changed in order to match the changes made while optomizing the css code.
